# Library App

### I built a library app where patrons can view a list of books.
Additionally, patrons can: 
Search for books
Check out books
Return books
Filter by availability
Filter by currently checked out books

### Instructions
Type in the search box to search for a book.
Use the show all books filter to display all books.
Use the show available books filter to only display books that can be checked out.
Use the show checked out books filter to only display books that are currently checked out.
Enter the patrons name to check out an available book.
Return a book so that it becomes available again.

### Additional features
When patrons check out a book, a due date is generated. Patrons are given 14 days from the day the book is checked out.
localStorage automatically saves books, search query, and filter settings.
useState data persistence on startup.
